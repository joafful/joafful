### Hi there 👋

These are my first small steps🐾 to try and learn how to use github, hoping my journey will become easier!
I took early retirement from a teaching career, mostly as a computing teacher, but I also taught other subjects. 
I'm now a learner on a course which will introduce me to github, html, css, python, javascript and associated frameworks.
My hope is to be in a position to be confident and capable enough to apply for part time, remote tech positions.
